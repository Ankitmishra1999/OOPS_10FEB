    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",

    "\n",
    "The close() function in Python is used to close an opened file. \n",
    "It is essential to close a file after you have finished working with \n",
    "it because it releases the resources associated with the file. \n",

    "Resource Management: When a file is opened, the operating system reserves some system resources to handle\n",
    "read and write operations on that file. If you do not close the file properly, \n",
    "those resources may not be released until the Python script terminates or the program exits.\n",
    "If your script opens many files without closing them,\n",
    "it can lead to resource leaks and may cause your program to run out of available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity: File buffers are used to improve I/O performance. When you write data to a file, \n",
    "it is often stored in memory temporarily before being physically written to the disk. \n",
    "If you do not close the file properly, the data in the buffer may not be flushed to the disk,\n",
    "and you might lose data in case of program termination or system crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "File Locking: Some operating systems have file-locking mechanisms to prevent multiple processes \n",
    "from modifying the same file simultaneously. If you don't close the file properly, \n",
    "it might still be locked, preventing other processes from accessing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency and Correctness: Properly closing files ensures thatall the data has been written\n",
    "or read correctly, and the file is in a consistent state.\n",
    "It prevents any data truncation or incomplete reads/writes\n",
    "that could happen if the file is not closed properly. "
